# 🏓 Custom Pong Game

A creative twist on the classic Pong game built with Python's `turtle` module. This version features a unique downward bounce mechanic — when the ball hits a paddle, it always bounces downward instead of reversing direction like in the traditional game.

## 🎮 Features

- ✅ Custom ball behavior: always bounces downward from paddles
- ✅ Independent left and right paddles
- ✅ Score tracking with a modular `score.py` file
- ✅ Clean, object-oriented design using Python classes
- ✅ Responsive keyboard controls

## 🕹️ Controls

- **Right Paddle:** Up / Down arrow keys
- **Left Paddle:** W / S keys
